Game development is one of the most interesting tracks there is, many developers enjoy it and there are developers who develop games just for having fun. Creating games requires whatТs called a game engine, which is a software that is used as the infrastructure for building the game and defines what the game has and what it can do.
If youТre familiar with Epic Games and Fortnight, Epic Games is, in fact, a game engine and Fortnight is built upon it. The languages used in game development are mostly C++, C# since it requires a lot of memory optimization and fast performance to create rich graphics. ItТs not limited to C++ and C#, however, and it kind of is about which engine youТre using and which platform youТre targeting, Lua and Java are also very famous candidates in this industry.
Creating mobile applications is a little tricky, as there is more than one operating system for mobiles and the different operating system would require different languages for these applications. An operating system is the piece of software on your device that is responsible for dealing with the hardware of this device, itТs the layer that sits between the application you create and the hardware, whether itТs a mic or a touchscreen or GPS. The most two common operating systems are Android and IOS. Android is most commonly used in Samsung while IOS is used in Apple. To create Android apps, youТd need either Java or Kotlin, and for creating IOS applications youТd need Objective-C or Swift. Recently, it became possible to create mobile applications for both Android and IOS using Javascript or Dart.
